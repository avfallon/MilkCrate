Problem Statement: I need to create a stable, fully functional recipe program that runs locally on your computer.
This program must be fully bootable from a single executable file that can be distributed.


Requirements Backlog
  - automatically install python/sql
  - automatically create a local SQL database for the machine
  - generate a .exe file that actually works
  - Fix the spinners so it's always text boxes
  - add an export feature (with an 'export all option')




Sprint 0 (March):
 - fix spinners so it doesn't save the "add new" thing
 - implement search
 - test/check the save function, sometimes it fails


Sprint 1 (April):
  - implement exporting recipes


Sprint 2 (May):
  - make python/sql automatically download
  - make an executable file
  - Distribute!
