> For filter_recipes, include some way so that if you're searching multiple columns, you only search the values
  appropriate for that column in that column
    e.g. searching cost and ethnicity for $, $$, mexican, and indian, you would only search cost for $, $$ and only
    ethnicity for mexican and indian
  - maybe pass in a col list and val list, and the val list is a list of lists, each internal list matching the
    index of the column it's in in col_list
